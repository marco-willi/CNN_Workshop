# Convolutional Neural Networks - Workshop

## Overview
This workshop is intended to be run on a machine with GPU support & uses jupyter notebooks to interactively run the code. However, also a non-GPU (CPU) version is avilable which runs fairly quick on a standard pc / labtop.

The goal of the workshop is to use Keras to build a CNN on a small data set. The idea is to become familiar with how to set up Keras to train a model.

## Prerequisites
To run model with Cat / Dog images you can get the images here:

To run model with MNIST data nothing needs to be downloaded.

To run model with Elephant / Zebra data a specific Zooniverse AMI has to be used (not available for the public).
